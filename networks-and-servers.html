            <h3>Secure collaboration across the internet</h3>
            <p>The rise of cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Dropbox, and Slack
               has revolutionized how teams communicate and share resources across geographic boundaries. 
               These platforms allow users to access documents, spreadsheets, and applications in real 
               time, ensuring that team members are always working with the latest data. <br><br>They also support 
               various levels of user permissions, so administrators can manage who has the ability to 
               view or modify shared content. While these tools offer powerful collaboration features, they 
               also become targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit weak passwords, outdated software, 
               or unencrypted data transmissions. Ensuring security means implementing strong password 
               policies, using multi-factor authentication, and regularly updating software.Secure internet
               collaboration also involves considering legal and regulatory requirements for data privacy 
               and compliance. Organizations handling customer or employee data must comply with laws such 
               as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Health Insurance Portability and 
               Accountability Act (HIPAA). This requires transparent data handling practices and secure 
               storage systems. Additionally, users must be trained in cybersecurity awareness—knowing how 
               to spot phishing emails, use secure file transfer protocols, and follow best practices for 
               virtual meetings. In the digital age, secure collaboration is more than just using the right 
               tools; it's about creating a culture of responsibility and implementing consistent, system-wide

            <h3>Types and functions of networking and wireless connections</h3>
            <p>Wireless connections, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, have become indispensable in modern computing. 
               Wi-Fi enables devices to access the internet or local networks without physical cabling, offering 
               the convenience of mobility while maintaining high-speed connections. Bluetooth, on the other hand, 
               supports short-range communication between devices like keyboards, headphones, and mobile phones. 
               Cellular networks (3G, 4G, and 5G) extend wireless networking beyond local areas by providing 
               mobile internet access via cell towers. Each of these technologies serves different use cases, 
               and their adoption depends on factors such as distance, bandwidth needs, and environmental constraints. 
               For example, a smartphone may switch between Wi-Fi and cellular data depending on availability and 
               signal strength.The functions of networking go beyond just enabling internet access—they also support 
               file sharing, remote access, centralized data management, and communication services such as VoIP and 
               video conferencing. In enterprise environments, networks allow for centralized control of data security, 
               user permissions, and application deployment.</p>

                <figcaption>Server networks form the foundation of most organizational IT infrastructures <br>
                            by providing centralized services and resources to connected client devices. <br>
                            A server network typically includes various types of servers—such as file servers, <br>
                            mail servers, web servers, and database servers—each dedicated to a specific function. <br>
                            These servers manage the storage, retrieval, and processing of data, ensuring that all <br>
                            users on the network can access the information they need without duplicating resources.

            <h3>Description of the common functionality of server networks</h3>
            <p>One of the key aspects of server networks is the ability to enforce policies and manage
               user access across a centralized system. Through directory services like Microsoft 
               Active Directory, administrators can authenticate users, assign permissions, and deploy 
               updates from a single console. This greatly reduces the administrative overhead 
               associated with managing individual devices and improves consistency in software and 
               security configurations. Server networks also make it easier to implement backup and 
               disaster recovery solutions, since data is stored centrally and can be replicated or 
               restored in case of hardware failure or cyberattack. These features are crucial for 
               businesses and institutions that rely on the integrity and availability of their 
               digital resources. <br><br>In addition to access control and data storage, server networks 
               play a vital role in hosting applications, websites, and collaborative platforms 
               used by employees or customers. Application servers can deliver software experiences 
               over the network without requiring users to install programs locally, while web 
               servers handle requests from browsers and serve dynamic or static content to users 
               worldwide. Server networks are also the backbone of internal communications, enabling 
               email, instant messaging, and voice-over-IP services within organizations. As cloud 
               computing becomes more widespread, many of these functions are being extended or 
               migrated to hybrid environments where on-premises and cloud-based servers work in 
               unison. Regardless of the architecture, understanding the common functionality of 
               server networks is essential for anyone involved in IT support, system administration, 
               or network management</p>
